## Important Notes

- Multiple Controllers are supported (P1 is master, P2 currently only available in "Pong" game)
- The menu movement with the JoyStick is "whack". I recommend using the D-pad for navigation and the JoySticks in-game
- Navigation in the "Settings" app requires to use the D-pad

## Gamepad Controls

### JoySticks

- Left, Right

### Buttons

- A, B, X, Y
- RB, LB
- D-pad: Up, Down, Left, Right

## Usage / Gameplay

*To be explained*

## Known Bugs

- Fetching controller data in **Firefox Browser** seems to be slower than usual (I recommend using Chromium or WebKit based browsers)
