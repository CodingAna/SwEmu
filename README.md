## Important Notes

- Currently there's a virtual JoyStick but for starting and/or quitting a game you need to press controller buttons (A, B on Xbox) and optionally the pause button to pause the CoinCollect-game.
- The menu movement with the JoyStick is "whack". It's recommended to use the D-pad for navigation and the JoyStick in-game.
